    <h2>Backyard Brawl - Generalist Programmer</h2>
    

    <article class="text-body">

      <p>
        <b>Backyard Brawl</b> is a chaotic multi-gamemode party game, supporting 2-4 players for both local and online play. 
        I worked on this project with seven other MSU students as a networking, gameplay and systems programming, contributing a large variety 
        of work to the development of the game. This project will have a full steam release in late 2025.

      <p>
        During my work on this project, I gained a plethora of valueble experience networking. This project utilized
        Netcode for GameObject, the Unity 6 networking solution. 
        <br>
        <br>
        I learned various strategies of optmizing online play, 
        such as favoring the attacker in combat to create a more satisfying experience. I used a similar strategy to 
        approach players colliding with cars. This means the collider present on the client is the one used in collision
        detection, and the player will only die to a car when a car appears close enough to kill them.

        Backyard Brawl features a variety of collectible items, such as candy in the Candy Collectathon mode 
        and tickets in the laserball mode. I created a modular collectible class to accomadate the different 
        collectibles. This class contains logic for key parts of collectibles such as animations and player inventory
        interaction.

      <h3>Event System</h3>
      <p>
        I created a modular event system that allows designers to create unique events that display animated
        text and call a Unity event to carry out the event (pictured to the right). Below are a couple of the events I scripted for the 
        Candy Collectathon gamemode.

      <h3>Power-ups and Hazards</h3>
      
      
      <p>
        Backyard Brawl features six unique power-ups, five of which I programmed. Each power-up required a different
        approach, providing interesting challenges to solve and network to maintain fairness in online play.

        <div class="floatleft">
          <img alt="Screenshot of Trick or Treat Fighters X 3D gameplay" src="images/WerewolfMask.gif">
        </div>
        The gif to the left shows the "werewolf mask" power-up. This power-up gives the player a circle around representing 
        the area of effect. Once actived, any players in this radius are stunned for a couple seconds.
        <br>
        <br>
        <br>

          <img alt="Screenshot of Trick or Treat Fighters X 3D gameplay" src="images/StinkBomb.gif">
        </div>
        I also programmed a stink bomb hazard that players may encounter. This item (gif to the right)
        causes players to emit a stink cloud and explodes them after 10 seconds unless they pass it onto another player by kicking them.
