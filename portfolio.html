        Here are some game projects I've worked on:

      <p>
        Trick or Treat Fighters X 3D is a Halloween themed candy collecting party game, supporting
        2-4 players. I worked on this project as a gameplay programmer, implementing mechanics such as:
        house spawning/looting, candy spawning, cars, player death, chainsaw enemy AI, and more. I am very proud of this project,
        and highly recommend checking it out! Some of our team (myself included) are continuing development on this project for
        a full release on Steam, which will include new gamemodes and online play.

    </div>
    <p>
      Adventurer's Anomalous is a 2D fantasy guild management game where you take on the role
      of guild leader. This systems-heavy game has you manage your recruits and income to expand
      your guild and maintain the health and happiness of your members. I did a large portion of 
      systems and UI programming on this project, using scriptable objects to store and interact
      with guild data.

      <p>
        Supermarket Sprint is a top-down puzzle game where the player is given a task to find 
        various items in a supermarket. This game prototype was developed with classmate Andrew 
        Tran in November 2022. I worked on this project as a lead programmer and designer, and created
        most of the game systems, including the player movement, task system, item spawning, collection,
        UI, and aisle mechanics.

  <p>
    "The Other Side"  is a  work in progress turn-based RPG  solo project I've been working 
    on over the course of two years. It currently has a playtime of about three hours.
    This project taught me much of what I know regarding technical design, as that's 
    how I've spent most of my time on it.
