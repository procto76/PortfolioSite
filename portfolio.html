        Here are some game projects I've worked on:

      <h3>Trick or Treat Fighters X 3D</h3>

      </div>
      <p>
        Trick or Treat Fighters X 3D is a Halloween themed candy collecting party game, supporting
        2-4 players. I worked on this project as a gameplay programmer, implementing mechanics such as:
        house knocking, candy spawning, cars, player death, and more. I am very proud of how this game turned out,
        and highly recommend checking it out!

      <p>
        Market Mayhem is is a 3D online multiplayer hide and seek game! Players will get 
        the opportunity to play as hiders or guards. The game began development under MSU's 
        Spartasoft Studio club in September 2023. I worked as a UI programmer on this project,
        doing programming and implementation for the player HUD.

    </div>
    <p>
      Sugar Pie Mafia"  is a 2D puzzle slingshot game based around baking pies to then 
      throw at enemies of the pie mafia. The bulk of my contribution was the programming 
      for the pies and their abilities. The game was created in 48 hours  during the February 
      2023 Game Jam hosted by MSU.

      <p>
        Supermarket Sprint is a top-down puzzle game where the player is given a task to find 
        various items in a supermarket. This game prototype was developed with classmate Andrew 
        Tran in November 2022. I worked on this project as a lead programmer and designer, and created
        most of the game systems, including the player movement, task system, item spawning, collection,
        UI, and aisle mechanics.

  <p>
    "The Other Side"  is a  work in progress turn-based RPG  solo project I've been working 
    on over the course of two years. It currently has a playtime of about three hours.
    This project taught me much of what I know regarding technical design, as that's 
    how I've spent most of my time on it.
